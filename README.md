# Insurance_claim_prediction
Predicting insurance claim outcomes

About Dataset: The Dataset contains information on policyholders having the attributes like policy tenure, age of the car, age of the car owner, the population density of the city, make and model of the car, power, engine type, etc. and the target variable indicating whether the policyholder files a claim in the next 6 months or not.

The problem statement: based on the features of this data set we are trying to figure out if the policy holder will file a claim relatively soon.
